# mkapp

make a new app easily
mkapp is a command line tool that helps you to create a new app easily. It uses the mkapp.py script to create a new app with the given name and command.
I made this tool bc I was tired of creating a new directory and opening it in vscode.

NOTE: MAKE A ISSUE IF YOU WANT NEW THINGS!!!
